# Search Movie - SSR and CSR with React

**Author:** Jorge de Oliveira Neto


**External API:** OMDb API


------------

## First steps:

When downloading, run:

`yarn` or `npm i` to install the packages


After:

`yarn build` or npm `run build` to run the spec


And then:

`yarn ssr` or npm `run ssr` to turn on the server

and

`yarn start` or `npm run start` to upload the app-client



#### Observation:

> The `yarn serve` or `npm run serve` command runs the previous two commands in parallel, but this feature is still in beta in this project and may not work.

With the applications running, you can access and test:
